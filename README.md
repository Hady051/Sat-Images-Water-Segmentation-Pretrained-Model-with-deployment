### Notebook Highlights

* Matched the correct masks to images, since there are more masks than images in the dataset folder.

* I applied Min Max Scaler for Normalization instead of dividing by 255 because for some bands, the pixel intensity is above 255.

* * Visualized each band of the images

* Computed water indices to add more band that will be more beneficial for the model to understand the water bodies like:
*  * **NDWI â€“ Normalized Difference Water Index**
   * **MNDWI - Modified NDWI**
   * **AWEI_SH - Automated Water Extraction Index (Shadow version)]**
  
Then added these water indices as extra channels to the 12 existing channels of the SAT images. 

* Applied different Augmentation using `albumentations` and applied the same augmentations for both the images and the corresponding masks.

* **Fine-Tuned a pretrained model** `res-net 34` and loaded ImageNet weights for 3 channels out of the 15 (12+3) using `PyTorch`.

* Visualized the Model's **losses** and **IOU** curves.

* Evaluated the model by **IOU**, **rcall**, **precision**, **f1 score** metrics

* Visualized the `Satellite Image`, `Ground Truth Mask` and the `Predicted Mask`.

* Deployed the model by using `streamlit` and `Ngrok`.
